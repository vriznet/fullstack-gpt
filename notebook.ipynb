      "Victory Mansions is a residential building located in London, the chief city of Airstrip One. It has glass doors and a hallway that smells of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. The building has seven flights of stairs, with Winston Smith's flat being on the seventh floor. A large colored poster of a man with a heavy black mustache is displayed at one end of the hallway. The building is equipped with a telescreen, and the electricity is cut off during daylight hours as part of the economy drive for Hate Week. From the roof of Victory Mansions, one can see all four Ministries of the government simultaneously: the Ministry of Truth, Ministry of Peace, Ministry of Love, and Ministry of Plenty. The telescreen in Winston's living-room is placed in an unusual position, opposite the window, and there is a shallow alcove likely intended for bookshelves.\n"
